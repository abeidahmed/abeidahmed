# ![Hello, I'm Abeid Ahmed](./assets/image.png)

Iâ€™m a **full-stack software engineer** with experience of over 2 years. I have
been leveraging technologies such as Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, React,
StimulusJS, and the likes of others to solve real-world problems.
I love writing clean and expressive code. It may sound too straightforward, but
the fact is that I would love to get paid for writing any of the
languages/frameworks mentioned above.

If you're interested in hiring me or working with me, you can [visit my portfolio](https://abeidahmed.me)
to better understand the skills and the experience that I have accumulated over
the years.
